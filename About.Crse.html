        <p><strong>Computer Science & Engineering :  </strong>
            is a branch of electrical engineering that integrates several fields of electrical engineering , electronics engineering and Computer Science required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineering is referred to as Electrical and Computer engineering OR Computer Science and Engineering at some universities
            Computer engineers require training in electrical engineering, electronic engineering, Computer Science, hardware-software integration <br> software design, and software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, and can encompass areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers.

In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world.[31] Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a new

        <p><strong>Electrical Engineering :  </strong>
            is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

            Main article: History of electrical engineering
            early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".[1] He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge.[2] By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.
            <br>
            Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering.[5] Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering <br>
            Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.[6][7] Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of ).

            "AI" redirects here. For other uses, see AI (disambiguation), Artificial intelligence (disambiguation), and Intelligent agent.
             Part of a series on Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.

             An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.
             Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large).

             In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future.

        <p><strong>Civil Engineering : </strong>
            is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.
            <br>
            Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to Fortune Global.
            <br>
            Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley <br>
            civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing.

        <p><b>Other Imformation  </b> LThe benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed professional engineer may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients."[20] This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in Quebec.[21] No such legislation has been enacted in other countries the United Kingdom. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of Queensland. Almost all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics which all members must abide by.

        The development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s.[56][57] The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971.[56] The Intel 4004 was designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon-gate MOS technology,[56] along with Intel's Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.[58] The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal computers, and the microcomputer revolution.
